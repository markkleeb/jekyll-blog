<h2>Programmable Arduino Synth</h2>
<p>
Alright, getting things done early! For August, I took an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> shield Steph got me for Christmas from <a href="http://www.critterandguitari.com/" target="_blank">Critter and Guitari</a>, programmed it, and built it into a case so I could use it on the <a href="http://stoishere.com/?p=618" target="_blank">Fundustrial Revolution Tour</a>, which departs tomorrow. Anyone reading this from Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Richmond, or NYC should come and check out the mayhem.
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, here is what the synth looked like after I put the kit together:

You can see that the pots just sort of hang out at the top and the buttons are those really tiny momentary switches. Sure, it sounded cool, but not very practical for a touring setup.
</p>
<p>
So I decided to build an enclosure:

<p>
Nice, easy plywood enclosure. I didn't have any scrap metal lying around for the top, but I did have some plexiglass. Let me tell you, drilling through plexiglass is NOT a fun time:

</p>
<p>
This probably took longer than anything else related to this project. We actually had to spray water on the plexiglass as we drilled to prevent cracking. 
</p>
<p>
Next were the buttons. Now, the surface-mounted buttons were not going to cut it, so I needed something that would press down on them from the faceplate. I ordered a 1/8" wooden dowel from <a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/" target="_blank">mcmastercarr</a>, along with some rubber washers to keep them in place. Steph glued the washers on the bottom side of the dowel pieces and we dropped them into the plexiglass holes:

After adding a 1/4" jack in the side, the synth was almost finished:

I decided to finish the wooden case with a layer of Tolex. After a fun night with glue, the finished Arduino Synth was ready for the road. Hereâ€™s the video demo, as promised:
