<h3>Overview</h3>
            
            <p>
            	<a href="http://musicalturk.com">Musical Turk</a> is an online database of crowd-sourced musical samples. The intention is that all of these loops will be incorporated into a performance where audience members will have the opportunity to remix them into a musical composition.

            <p>
            	To <a href="http://www.musicalturk.com/upload">contribute</a>, follow the instructions listed under the type of loop, and upload a file. All of the samples uploaded to Musical Turk are open-source and can be downloaded individually and remixed.

        	<h3>Technical</h3>
        	<p>
        	The samples are uploaded to a database with an open API that can be accessed at <a href="http://musicalturk.com/data/loops">musicalturk.com/data/loops</a> During each performance, an openFrameWorks sketch downloads these loops and displays the names and titles in the corresponding category.

        </p>

        <p>
        	A Python sketch continuously checks the database for new loops during the performance and transfers them to openFrameWorks, so that anyone watching at home can contribute to the performance in real time.

        </p>
        <p>
        There are various consoles in the performance space for audience members to manipulate and remix the crowd-sourced samples. There is also a recording console so that musicians and audience members can contribute new samples to the website during the performance.

    	<p>
    	Using a combination of trained musicians and curious audience members, a Musical Turk performance is an exploration in crowd-sourced composition. No two performance sound alike, and new loops are being added to the website continually.
