For Halloween, we pulled a team together to create a photo booth for our annual NYU party. Using an animated gif library in Processing (thanks to <a href="http://www.dannewoo.com/" target="_blank">Danne Woo</a>), an HD webcam (thanks to <a href="http://www.penacosta.com/" target="_blank">Guilherme Costa</a>), and some killer CSS and web fonts (<a href="http://cibernetic.com/" target="_blank">Yucef Merhi</a>), the <a href="http://www.screambooth.us" target="_blank">ScreamBooth</a> was created.

We set up a small microphone attached to an Arduino. When someone screams loud enough, the Arduino triggers the Processing sketch to snap four quick photos in succession. These photos are then saved to Dropbox and the image IDs are posted to a Python web app. We had a live website that was constantly updating as more pictures were added.

Though optimized for Halloween, the hope is that the Scream Booth can be modified for any holiday or occasion. Look for it at an upcoming party in NYC!
